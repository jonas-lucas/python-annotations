# Python Annotations

A repository to take some notes about annotations in Python language.

I use this repository for my studies about `typing`.

### Getting Started

To make the most of this repository, it's recommended that you have the `mypy` package installed in your Python interpreter. If you haven't already, you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Once `mypy` is installed, you can use it to perform type checking on your Python code. Simply run the following command in your terminal, replacing `main.py` with the name of the Python file you want to check:

```bash
mypy main.py
```

If your code adheres to the specified type hints and annotations, you should see a message like this:

```bash
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```
